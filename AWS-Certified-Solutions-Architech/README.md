__Review Question:__ Page 56 __Answer:__ Page 490

__Global Infrastructure__  
You can achieve high availability by deploying your application across multiple _Availability Zones_. Redundant instances for each tier (for example, web, application and database) of an application should be placed in distinct _Availability Zones_, thereby creating a multisite solution. At a minimum, the goal is to have an independent copy of each application stack in two or more _Availability Zones__   

__Accessing the Platform__   
To access AWS Cloud services, you can use the
* AWS Management Console (Web)
* AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
* AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)

## Chapter 2: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Glacier Storage  
Nearly any application running in AWS uses _Amazon S3_, either directly or indirectly.  
_Amazon S3_ offers a range of storage classed designed for various generic use cases: general purpose, infrequent access, and archive.

__Tip__: Set a data retrieval policy to limit restores to the free tier or to a maximum GB-per-hour limit to avoid or minimize Amazon Glacier restore fees.
